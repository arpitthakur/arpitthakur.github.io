RECURSION
Recursion is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.
Most loops can be written in a recursive style and some functional languages.
However, JavaScript functional coding style does not support recursive function, we need to be aware that most JavaScript 
compilers are not currently optimized to support them safely.

Recursion is best applied when you need to call the same function repeatedly with different parameters from within a loop.
It can be used in many situations, it is most effective for solving problems involving iterative branching, such as math, sorting or
non-linear data structures.

Recursive functions are also naturally easy to test because they are easy to write purely.
Recursion is favored in functional programming is that it allows for the construction of code that does not require setting and maintaining state with local variables.

For example: 
function factorial (n) {
//0 ! = 1, 1 ! = 1
if ( n > 0 && n <= 1 ) {
	return 1 ;
}
